Man, just stumbled out of Squad 36 and wow, my brain's like a blender right now. I think I lost a decade in that theater, or maybe just my sense of time. People shuffling, popcorn stuck to my hoodie... Seriously, my back feels like an accordion left in the rain.

Squad 36 is... how do you even put it? It's like if you took a rollercoaster ride and mixed it with a cat's first encounter with a laser pointer. Just random flashes and curves everywhere. The opening scene — was it raining or were those my tears? Felt like a water balloon fight in the middle of a desert. And then John's face when he saw, I don't know, the hamburgler or whatever that twist was. Boom, right in the kisser, never saw it coming — or was it me who dropped the popcorn? 

> Honestly, the scene where Maria snaps her fingers and suddenly they're in a forest, felt like I was a goldfish trying to climb a tree. You ever feel like a soft-serve ice cream getting dipped in hot chocolate? Neither have I until that moment. And my seat had a squeak that was like a sad violin every time I leaned.

Oh, speaking of leaning, that matrix-style dodge when Robbie danced out of the explosion. It's like he was a spaghetti noodle taken out of boiling water just trying to air-dry. Remind me to ask Claire if she still wants to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   – I need to re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   just to figure out if my brain was on vacation or if that plot really did a somersault.

The sound in there, though. Good lord. Like an angry squirrel arguing with a jet engine. But the last scene, wow. It was like they wrapped everything in a banana leaf and called it a day. Didn't feel finished, but maybe that's the point?

🍿😵 All this action and I’m out here clutching my soda cup like it’s the Holy Grail.
